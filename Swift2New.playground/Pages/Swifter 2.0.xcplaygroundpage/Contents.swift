//: #### Swift 2.0 is modern, powerful, expressive, and easy to use. It extends Swift 1.2 with:
//:* Error handling. Now you can create routines that throw, catch, and manage errors in Swift. You can surface and deal with recoverable errors, such as “file-not-found” or network timeouts. Swift 2.0 error handling interoperates transparently with NSError.
//:* Availability. Availability features enable you to mark up methods with the OS that they are available on, providing compile time checking and preventing unavailable methods from being used. You can adopt new APIs while still deploying back to older OS versions. Compile-time errors are provided when you’re using an API that isn’t guaranteed to be available on the deployment target.
//:* Testability. With testability, you are now able to write tests of Swift 2.0 frameworks and apps without having to make all of your internal routines public. Use @testable import {ModuleName} in your test source code to make all public and internal routines usable by XCTest targets, but not by other framework and app targets.
//:* Protocol extensions. You can now add methods and properties to any class that conforms to a particular protocol, allowing you to reuse more of your code. For example, in the standard library, instead of having to use global functions for all of the generic algorithms in the standard library (such as map, filter, and sort), those generic algorithms are now available as methods on all of the collection types.
