# Swift Standard Library
> **Important:**
> This is a preliminary document for an API or technology in development. Apple is supplying this information to help you plan for the adoption of the technologies and programming interfaces described herein for use on Apple-branded products. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this document should be tested with final operating system software and final documentation. Newer versions of this document may be provided with future betas of the API or technology.

The Swift standard library implements the basic data types, algorithms, and protocols you use to write apps in Swift. It includes high-performance fundamental data types such as `String` and `Array`, along with generic algorithms such as `sort()` and `filter()`. Powerful protocols that describe shared traits and behaviors define reusable building blocks for higher level types. Classes in the Foundation framework with standard library counterparts–such as `NSArray` and `Array`–are automatically bridged. When you work with Objective-C frameworks, your Swift code gains the performance improvements and flexibility of the Swift standard library.

On each page of this playground, you will experiment with Swift standard library types and high-level concepts using visualizations and practical examples. You will also learn how the Swift standard library uses protocols and generics to express powerful constraints.
